## Chowtime

Chowtime is an in-progress application designed to help indecisive people decide where to eat.


**To-Do List:**

1. UI
2. Geolocation
3. Filters (Types of cuisine, Price, Rating, Distance)
4. ML

*July 7, 2018*

A Python script was written in Jupyter Notebook to randomly retrieve a restaurant in Syosset from the Yelp API.

Eventually, in the UI, applying filters should just call search_results = getResults().
Generating a new restaurant should just call print(chooseRestaurant()).
