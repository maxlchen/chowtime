## Chowtime

Chowtime is an in-progress application designed to help aspiring foodies decide where to eat.
The script is currently accessible through <a href = "http://intellegostudio.com/chowtime">intellegostudio.com/chowtime</a>.

**To-Do List:**

1. UI: in-progress
2. <del>Geolocation</del>
3. Filters (Types of cuisine, Price, Rating, Distance): in-progress
4. ML
5. Add retrieval of restaurant information

*August 3, 2018*

<i>Some</i> important filters have been added. Different CSS and HTML inputs were added, including range bars for distance, as well as a handful of food categories. CSS was added, as well as a navigation bar that will link the user back to the Chowtime homepage.

*July 29, 2018*

The Python script has been successfully integrated into the web through the usage of PHP and JavaScript. Geolocation functionality has been added. Basic CSS styling has been added to the web page, with hopefully more to come.

*July 7, 2018*

A Python script was written in Jupyter Notebook to randomly retrieve a restaurant in Syosset from the Yelp API.

Eventually, in the UI, applying filters should just call search_results = getResults().
Generating a new restaurant should just call print(chooseRestaurant()).
