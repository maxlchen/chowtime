## Chowtime

Chowtime is an in-progress application designed to help indecisive people decide where to eat.
The script is currently accessible through <a href = "http://www.zemcw.stream/chowtime">zemcw.stream/chowtime</a>.

**To-Do List:**

1. UI
2. <del>Geolocation</del>
3. Filters (Types of cuisine, Price, Rating, Distance)
4. ML

The Python script has been successfully integrated into the web through the usage of PHP and JavaScript. Geolocation functionality has been added. Basic CSS styling has been added to the web page, with hopefully more to come.

*July 7, 2018*

A Python script was written in Jupyter Notebook to randomly retrieve a restaurant in Syosset from the Yelp API.

Eventually, in the UI, applying filters should just call search_results = getResults().
Generating a new restaurant should just call print(chooseRestaurant()).
